## Basics of ICS Pentesting (paid/free) - 

### Paid 

* [Fundamentals of ICS/SCADA CyberSecurity](https://www.udemy.com/course/fundamentals-of-ot-cybersecurity/) - ***Definately recommend it. if you want to understand faster and everything is covered there.!!!***

### Free 

* **What is ICS, Scada, HMI mainly.**
* **understand concept of MTU, RTU.**
* **Difference between  IT and OT Security and what's the main difference in both compared to other.***
* **OT is vulnerable in nature but what makes it vulnerable and why we can't resolve it by encryption.** 
*  **Understand ICS protocols for example  Modbus, S7, Profinet, Profibus  and various other.**

#### ***IMPORTANT - We can infiltrate in ICS as per configured environment and all depends on the victim's environment. you just have to explore many amazing things by yourself :)  (just research)***
